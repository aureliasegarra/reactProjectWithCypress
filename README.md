Project not completed

## Context 🗓
Project developed as a junior web developer. 
I realized the implementation of these tests during my internship in BTS SIO SLAM. The subject of this internship, in the start up Iole Solutions, was about the integration of E2E tests in an application under development. This is one of the reasons that pushed me to get interested in Cypress
